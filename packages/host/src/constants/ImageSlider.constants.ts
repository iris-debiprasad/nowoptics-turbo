Although I only come in when I get an exam and new glasses a few times every few years, Heather remembers me! I was in today to get new glasses. Everyone was extremely efficient and professional. Two young women helped me in the initial stages of the exam process and then at the end of the process when I was choosing glasses. Both were extremely professional, well trained, polite, and engaging. The doctor who tested my vision was also extremely efficient and friendly. I am looking forward to coming in to get my new glasses. I find visiting this Stanton Optical location a top-notch experience!",
