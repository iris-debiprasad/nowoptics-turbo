    Q: "Is Prescription Renewal a real eye exam?",
    A: `We provide you with a real vision test to check if your vision has changed from your current prescription.Your results from the vision test are reviewed by a certified and licensed doctor in your state who will renew your prescription if all looks good. 
                  <br /><br />Prescription Renewal is not a comprehensive eye exam and cannot check the health of your eyes.If we find your vision has changed, we will refer you for a comprehensive eye exam at one of our <a href="/schedule-exam"  style="color: #002e6d;">nearby locations. </a>`,
  },
  {
    KEY: "2",
    Q: "Do I need my current prescription?",
    A: "Yes, the doctor needs to know what prescription to renew. Unless you got your prescription from us, we’ll need you to provide a photo of your doctor's signed prescription.",
  },
  {
    KEY: "3",
    Q: "Is Prescription Renewal the same thing as a comprehensive eye exam?",
    A: "No. Prescription Renewal only checks how well you see, and does not provide a full examination of your vision health.",
  },
  {
    KEY: "4",
    Q: "Can I use my phone or mobile device?",
    A: "No. Prescription Renewal requires you to be on a laptop or desktop computer to be able to have the best experience and get accurate results on your test.",
  },
  {
    KEY: "5",
    Q: "What computer permissions are needed?",
    A: "Our vision test requires microphone and camera access so our live technician can hear you and guide you on screen.",
  },

    KEY: "6",
    Q: "Is Prescription Renewal Free?",

  },
  {
    KEY: "7",
    Q: "Can I submit my receipt for prescription renewal to my insurance provider for reimbursement?",

    A: "Our guided experience is available from Monday through Saturday 10:00 am - 6:00 pm EST.",

    Q: "I can still see out of my current eyewear, but my prescription expired. Can you help?",

    Q: "What do I need to renew my prescription?",

  },
  {
    KEY: "12",
    Q: "Do I need to wear my eyewear during Prescription Renewal?",
    A: "Yes. You will be asked to read letters on a digital eye chart as part of the vision test. This helps the doctor know if your current prescription is still providing you with clear, accurate vision.",
  },
  {
    KEY: "13",
    Q: "Is there an age restriction for Prescription Renewal?",
    A: "Yes. Prescription renewal is only valid for patients between the ages of 18 and 50 years old. If you are out of that age range, we suggest you schedule an in-store eye exam.",
