For a square face, choose oval or round frames to soften the jawline, rimless or semi-rimless are great options too. For a round or oval face shape, select frames that are angular shaped such as square, rectangular, or cat-eye to help provide more definition. If you have a heart-shaped face, select frames with a narrow, bottom-heavy frame, round or square with rounded edges, cat-eye works too. In the end, the best tip is to try everything and wear what makes you feel good. You might surprise yourself.",

If your glasses are sitting too low on your nose:
For Wireframe glasses: Use your thumbs to push your nose pads closer together until they fit snugly against the sides of your nose.
For Plastic/Acetate glasses: Run warm water for 30 seconds over the part of your frame you want to bend in order to soften it. Next, bend inward at the bridge, the hinges or the bend of your temple arms to make the frame fit more snugly to your face.
If your glasses are pinching your nose:
For Wireframe glasses: Use your thumbs to spread the nose pads out until they fit comfortably.
For Plastic/Acetate glasses: Run warm tap water over your glasses until they are pliable (this should take about 30 seconds) and then bend the nose piece outward slowly until it fits comfortably on the bridge of your nose.",
